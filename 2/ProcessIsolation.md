## Process Isolation ##

### Example ###
In the example, the main program is run, and there are two applications available to the user, Note Taker 3000 and
(Psuedo)Random Number Generator.  In order to demonstrate process isolation, there is an option within Note Taker 3000
to "crash me" which simulates a crash, returning to the main program menu, but still allowing the program to conintue to run.

### Non-Example ###
The non example also contains a "crash me" option within Note Taker 3000, but instead of handling a crash well, it crashes
the entire program.
