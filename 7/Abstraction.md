## Abstraction ##

### Example ###
The example shows extraction by using the standard library hash template. The std lib hash functions are highly abstracted, in the sense that the only thing you need to know to use them is that you need to specify the data type of whatever you are hashing, the template takes care of the rest.  You don't see any details of the algorithm of the hash.

### Non-Example ###
In the non-example, a custom hash algorithm is shown, and then that hash is used.  This is not abstracted because all the details fo the hash are available for the programmer to see.
