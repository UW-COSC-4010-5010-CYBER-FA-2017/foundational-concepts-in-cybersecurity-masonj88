## Layering ##

### Example ###
In the example, the user is asked for first a password, and then a key, and then an access code, providing 3 layers of security in order to be given access.  If any of the three security layers is failed, the user is denied access.

### Non-Example ###
In the non-example, the user needs only input a password in order to gain access.  A single layer of protection is not as secure as multiple layers.
