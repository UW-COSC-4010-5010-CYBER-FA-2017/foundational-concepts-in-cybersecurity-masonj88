### Directions for Make ###

Make sure your current working directory is the root of the folder cloned/downloaded from Github.
`ls` should output "Makefile" along with the 10 folders and the README.md

If you're in the correct working directory: `make` will create a folder named "bin" within the working directory.
Bin will contain all of the executables.

`make` will also create a folder called "assembly" with all of the assembly versions of each example.
