## Minimization ##

### Example ###
The example is the same as the simplicity example.  This example also shows minimization because it doesn't take any arguments, thus reducing the number of possible attack vectors.

### Non-Example ###
The non-example is the same as the simplicity non-example. This shows lack of minimization compared to the example because there is another vector of attack; allowing arguments on the command line.
