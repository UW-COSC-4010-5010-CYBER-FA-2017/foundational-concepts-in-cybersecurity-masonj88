## Simplicity ##

### Example ###
This example of simplicity takes an array and sorts it using the standard library sort.  It doesn't allow you to choose with method you'd like to sort the array with, but its simple.

### Non-Example ###
The non-example takes a command-line argument. "bubble", "standard", and "insertion" are accepted command-line arguments, which allow you to have the array sorted by each of the respective sorts.  This is more complicated than not allowing the user to specify which sort to use.
