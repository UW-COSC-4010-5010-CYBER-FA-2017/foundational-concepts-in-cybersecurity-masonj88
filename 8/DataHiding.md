## Data Hiding ##

### Example ###
In the example, instead of listing all available users, and then all available databases (whether or not they have
access to those databases) the user is expected to know their username and the name of the database they are accessing without
the program telling them the options.

### Non-Example ###
In the non-example, prompts are given to show all possible users, and then all possible databases.  Although passwords and access
control are present, knowing all of the usernames and database names gives a potential attacker somewhere to start.
